<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2>
We have made a game that allows a user to play fully without using a traditional controller or any buttons.<br/>
Our game follows a simple formula. You controll a small ball on the screen that rolls based on the tilt of the accelerometer inside of the CC3200 board.
If you tilt the board heavily in a specific direction the ball will start to roll that direction. Try to make it into objectives and stay there to collect points! You can compete for a global highscore or simply play for fun offline. <br/><br/>

<h3 id="Gamemodes">The Three Gamemodes</h3>
Each gamemode is differentiated by how it utilizes the microphone. <br/><br/>
<li><b>Silent</b> mode makes it so the game does not even access the microphone. <ul>It is a way to play this game in areas where you can't make a lot of noise. As the controls are the easiest to manage here you only get 2 points per objective.</ul> </li>
<li><b>Classic</b> mode requires you to make noise in order for the ball to move. <ul>The ball quickly decelerates if you become quiet. You get 4 points per score in Classic.</ul></li>
<li><b>Screamer</b> mode has the ball care about the mic significantly more than classic. <ul>This meakes it extremely difficult to control, but you only need to touch the objective to score. It is still very difficult to control so you get 5 points per objective in Screamer.</ul></li>

<h1 id="market-survey">Market Survey</h1>
<p>This style of motion controlled game is common in the mobile app store.
  It is particularly analagous to games such as Doodle Jump which involve the user tilting their phone to move their character
  while going for some king of high score. It can also be compared to Fruit Ninja, another older mobile game with "gesture based" controls (slicing through things by sliding a finger).
  "High Score" games that can be picked up and played easily in short bursts are great fits for on the go gaming. 
  However, many of those games are not as popular and many will inudate users with ads or microtransactions in order to capitalize their userbase. </p>

<p>As of right now the mobile game space is rife with poor business practices
  such as bonuses for spending a large quantity of money at one time, or spending money frequently on in game purchases. This leads to more vulnerable users to get manipulated into spending more than they can reasonably afford. 
  Our game is a return to form of the marketplace and seeks to be a game you can hand to a kid while they are waiting without worrying if they will make a bunch of in-app purchases while you are looking away. Our game does not feature any kind of in app marketplace or advertisements.
</p></p>

    This finite state diagram focuses in on what an outline of the "main game loop" looks like. This demonstrates the ideas behind how the game fucntions.
    If you wanted to include advanced features like internet access or a gamemode select you have that happen near the top where the part labeled "main game loop" that runs until the timer runs out can be its own function call. 
    When outside of that function call the only thing you actually care about was the player's final score, so you can place the entire main game in a function and return out the final score.

  <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;flex:1 0 400px;">
    <p>This diagram then demonstrates how you can set up the menus so that you can implement all of the logic around playing the game. 
      The connect to the internet step is abstracted heavily at this phase as it is implementation specific and outside the scope of this guide here.</p>

<h2 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h2>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-evenly;">
  <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;flex:1 0 300px;">
    <p>Our system works based on the following connections. The directions of the arrows represent the flow of useful data.
    Commands will originate from the microcontroller in order to read the signals from the accelerometer and ADC, but data is usually one way.
    The OLED has no physical means of communication with the microcontroller as it does not even have a MISO wire connected.
    The AWS connection is the only one that requires both sending and recieving data.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<h3 id="cc3200">CC3200 Board</h3>
<p>All control and logic was handled by a CC3200 microcontroller
unit. We utilized the board's SPI to connect with the inbuilt accelerometer, inbuilt ADC to connect with the external microphone, and wifi connectivity to enable saving highscores </p>
<h2 id="functional-blocks">Functional Blocks</h2>
<h3 id="aws-iot-core">AWS IoT Core</h3>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;">
  <div style='display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;flex:1 0 200px'>
    The AWS IoT core allows our devices to communicate with ea central hub server that remembers the last score someone gives it. We did not design our code to account for many users playing at the same time, so our AWS server just returns the last score given to it.
    This means all users should Get to see if there is a new highscore before they upload their own score, or extra processing should be done on the server's side.
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="oled-display">OLED Display</h3>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;">
  <div style='display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;flex:1 0 400px'>
    <p>The OLED will display all of the information related to the game. The user has no other way to know what is going on in the game, so the screen is paramount.</p>
    <p>Connect the + symbol on the olded to VCC on the CC3200, G goes to Ground. From there you will need to connect the SI (data input), CL (Clock), DC (explains what to do with bits), R (reset), and OC (Chip Select) from the OLED to various pins on the CC3200 so that you can give the OLED commands. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="microphone">Microphone</h3>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;">
  <div style='display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;flex:1 0 400px'>
    The microphone is suprisingly easy to wire up for this project's purposes. It can be configured to have different gain, angles of attack, etc. But for this project all of its default settings work great! Simply connect GND to ground, Vdd to 5v, and the output to wherever your ADC is hooked up.
  </div>
</div>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The most significant challenges we faced were due to the interactions of the inbuilt ADC and the internet connection</p>
<h2 id="ibuilt-adc">Inbuilt ADC</h2>
<p>Our major issue from the ADC came from that we have never worked with any form of ADC before. We had a sample program built in from Texas Instruments that had the ADC go directly to the console.
  However, we needed the ADC to output a floating point value, so we ended up spending a lot of our time just debugging the code for that ADC and it had the behaviors of every "mic enabled" game mode each time we would edit it.
  At first, we had it work by configuring itself every time it was called, but that caused issues later on (see section on AWS). We eventually had everything work, but there was a struggle involved in learning how to use this new feature.
</p>
<h2 id="aws-problems">AWS and Internet Connectivity</h2>
<p>AWS also presented many issues to us even after we were able to post and get highscores. The main issue came from the fact that AWS would simply halt the entire program if it was run after we read the microphone input.
  This was a notable issue for our microphone centric game. We would also recieve errors for things being defined several times within our Get function if it was placed "lower down" in the code, something which should have no meaning for functions floating in global namespace.
  We are still unsure why that bug happened, but the program works now!
</p>
<h2 id="solution-to-challenges">Solution to Challenges</h2>
<p>We ended up completely reworking the entire microphone function of the game in order to make it so our internet connectivity worked, but we also developed a failstate mode in case there is no internet access.
  The game can also be run completely without input from the internet! We included a choice on bootup for if the user wants to compete on the global leaderboard so that if an issue does crop up, AWS shuts down, etc our game will always at least be playable.
</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>Given more time, we would rework the movement system with the microphone to feel better to control, add a deeper menu with a larger variety of gamemodes, or possibly even allow for a custom gamemode where user selects challenges to make the game harder for more points (similar to the Pact of Punishment in Hades).</p>
